'''
Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for 
the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain 
timestamp.

Implement the TimeMap class:

TimeMap() Initializes the object of the data structure.

void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) Stores the key key with the value
value at the given time timestamp.

String get(String key, int timestamp) Returns a value such that set was called 
previously, with timestamp_prev <= timestamp. If there are multiple such values, 
it returns the value associated with the largest timestamp_prev. If there are no 
values, it returns "".

        self.hashmap = defaultdict(list)

    def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
        self.hashmap[key].append((timestamp, value))

# Your TimeMap object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = TimeMap()
# obj.set(key,value,timestamp)
# param_2 = obj.get(key,timestamp)
